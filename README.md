# Password Cracking With Genetic Algorithm

* This program tries to crack a password named "Deep Learning 2022". This password can be changed if desired. The reason we give the password is to find the fitness value, but while the program cracks this password, it does not know the password. At the end of the program, the outputs of how many generations found the password and how many milliseconds it found are displayed.

* The genetic algorithm is run by taking the population size from the user.
